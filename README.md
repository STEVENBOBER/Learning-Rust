# Learning Rust: Notes & Projects

Welcome, fellow Rustaceans! ðŸ¦€

This repository serves as a living document of my journey learning the Rust programming language. Inside, you'll find my notes, hands-on projects, and experiments with Rustâ€”designed to deepen my understanding of this powerful systems programming language.

### About This Repo
- This is an **ever-evolving project**. As I learn more about Rust, this repository will continue to grow and adapt.
- Itâ€™s a mix of **notes** and **projects**, reflecting both conceptual learning and practical application.
- Learning is a continuous process, and so is this repo. 

Feel free to explore, learn, and share feedback.

Happy coding!
